  First Things First
subquestion: |
  If you lost food that you bought with your SNAP benefits because of a fire, flood, loss of electricity,broken refrigerator or freezer, or other disaster, the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) may be able to replace your SNAP benefits. 
  
  The most DTA can replace is one month of SNAP.

id: Screen two
question: |
  First Things First
subquestion: |
  DTA must get this form within 10 days after you reported the loss of food. If you submit this form within 10 days of the food loss, you do not need to make a separate report first.
continue button field: Screen_two

id: Screen three
question: |
 First Things First
subquestion: |
  You can report the loss by phone or in writing (must report within 10 days of the food loss). If you get cash benefits, call your case manager. If you only get SNAP, call 1‐877‐382‐2363.  
  
  You can also fax your report to 6178878765 or mail it to DTA Document Processing Center, P.O. Box 4406, Taunton, MA 02780.
  
  Here's a free tool you can use to fax the completed form to the DTA online: https://faxzero.com/
